# signup-page
I have created this app in such a way that if anyone signup on page it stores the data on mailchimp.
mailchimp is site which gives an free API to use.
on sign up page u have to give your first name, last name and email and when u click on sign me up button it saves the information and new page comes with success as heading and stores the information on mailchimp if any error occurs than new page comes with error and says to register again.
in above code i have not given API code because of security reasons. instead of api key i have mentioned API_KEY.
